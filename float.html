       <p>The CSS float property is used to position elements to the left or right side of a container. 
       It allows text and inline elements to<div class="clear"></div> wrap around it, creating flexible and organized layouts. 
       Float is often used for placing images beside text or arranging multiple boxes in a row.</p>
    </section>
    <div class="clear"></div>
    <p>When an element is floated, it is taken out of the normal document flow and moved to the left or right. 
       Other elements in the document will wrap around the floated element</p>
    <p>Float is useful for creating column layouts, image galleries, and sidebars. 
       For example, you can float an image to the left and have text appear neatly on its right. 
    <div class="block right">Hanif</div>
       Although modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid are more powerful, float still plays an important role in basic layout design.</p>
    <p>After floating elements, its important to clear them to prevent layout issues. 
       The clear property is used for this purpose. You can also use the “clearfix” method, 
       which automatically fixes overflow problems caused by floats, ensuring your layout stays neat and properly aligned.</p>
